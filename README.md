# Random forest models reveal academic and financial factors outweigh demographics in predicting completion of a year-round veterinary program

This repository contains the demo data and the example python code for the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association (JAVMA) article which is in-press.

### Overview

This repository contains example student data and the Python code to create one of the random forest machine learning models.  The code can be adapted to meet your analysis needs.  Please make sure to see the comments that help explain the code and point out important things such as ensuring your performance metrics use the testing datasets and not the entire dataset (training and testing).
